## Overview

This is a COVID-19 Statistics Fetching Application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using the [covid-193 API](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193/) to fetch live COVID-19 data for different countries.

It allows users to select a country from a dynamically populated dropdown and view real-time:
- New confirmed cases
- Total confirmed cases
- New deaths
- Total deaths
- Last updated date

---

### The Challenge

- Use fetch API with headers and API key securely via module export.  
- Dynamically populate a dropdown with all available countries.  
- Update DOM elements dynamically on user selection.  
- Display clear, readable COVID-19 data to users.  
- Style the app with **Bootstrap and custom CSS** for clean presentation.
